* Next up

1. bullets
   - [ ] shooting breaks the fleet changing, so fix that
   - [X] +firing a bullet accelerates the ship down+

2. explosions
   - [ ] add state to fleet for explosions
   - [ ] explosion x, y, frame
   - [ ] add draw function for each frame centered on x and y
   - [ ] lore is that invaders are capturing stars, so explosion
         releases a star, which maybe stays in place?
** Bugs

- [ ] curved part at the top of the invader leaves behind streaks,
  erasing needs to not curve that part. Try just erasing the whole
  stage on each frame?
  - [ ] probably just pass ~erase?~ to invader

- [ ] rename ~fleet~ -> ~life~ or ~stage~
- [ ] rename ~draw/ship*~
- [ ] rename ~draw/~ -> ~canvas/~

** Done

1. detect when the fleet is at the right edge of the screen
   - [x] find column position of the extrememots invader
   - [x] multiply by column width + offset
   - [x] xtreme-invader can use `max` or `min` to find first or last

2. move left as well as right
   - [x] one additional frame for down-right

3. read the keyboard events to move the ship
   - keyboard events are published on the channel already
   - [X] store extra state in the fleet to represent the ship's position
     and direction
   - [X] arrows apply acceleration, inertia is real
   - [X] match keyboard commands and call a function to update the ship
     direction
